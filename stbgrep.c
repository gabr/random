    My own attempt at writing a small C program that counts
    stb functions usages - inspired by:
    https://youtu.be/eAhWIO1Ra6M?si=gBvIX6GAxrXObqDY&t=3348

    My approach is different tho as I'm gonna try to use just the standard C
    library as (besides the fact that it has weird interfaces) I believe that
    it's quite capable and usable.  When writing a big project you would
    probably want to separate it into a platform layer - same way you would
    your operating system API - but for small one off programs it's fine.

    I'm also not dealing with opening and reading files here.  Including that
    into the program is not "the UNIX" way as that can be handled by the
    operating system.  It makes the program less flexible because then the data
    has to come from the files.  Without that the program is not only smaller
    and simpler but also can accept the data from anywhere - just pipe it in.
    Besides iterating over files in directories would have to be imlemented
    differently depending on the operating system - just a waste of time in
    aÂ small program.

    Usage:
        cat ~/code/nothings/stb/stb*_*.h | ./stbgrep.c | sort -n

    To be fair.  It took me longer than Sean to write this - approx 1.5h
    But not because I had problems or bugs, but rather because the mindset in C
    is different and I don't do this often so I'm not that familiar with
    standard library functions that are useful when writing this type of code.

    I wonder if with practice I could improve to a point to make it reasonable
    efficient - let's say to get down to 5-15 mins for such programs.
